# NOW — the shared session between Cursor and Claude Code

**Cursor Cloud, Cursor Desktop and Claude Code all work this repo and none of them can
see each other's chats.** No shared conversation, no Claude MCP in Cursor, no way to send
the other agent a message. The only things all of them read are **HubSpot** and **this
file**.

So this file is not documentation. It is the working memory of whichever agent is not
currently running, and the protocol below is how two agents that cannot talk avoid
destroying each other's work.

---

# PART 1 — THE PROTOCOL

## 1. The session board — claim before you touch

There is no file locking. This table is the substitute, and it works only because both
agents keep it honest.

| Agent | Claimed (UTC) | Working on | Touching (files / services) | Last commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cursor Cloud | 2026-08-31 17:10 UTC | HUD Megan follow-up (listing private) | `docs/oracle/NOW.md` (main) | pending |

**Rules**
- **Before editing shared code or restarting a service, add your row.** Commit and push
  that row *first*, before the work. It costs one commit and prevents the whole class.
- **Delete your row when you stop.** A finished agent leaves no claim.
- **A claim older than 2 hours with no newer commit from that agent is dead — take it.**
  Sessions crash and browsers close; a permanent lock is worse than no lock.
- **If a row is live and you need those files: work somewhere else.** Do not "just be
  careful". Add a line under HANDOFF saying what you wanted, and move on.

## 2. Everything lands on `main`

**Earned 30 Aug 2026.** NOW.md was created 25 Aug on branch
`cursor/intelliops-bd-money-play-abc0` and never merged. From `main` — what Claude Code
reads and Oracle runs — it did not exist, so a second copy was written five days later.
Both agents were right about their own branch and neither could see the other.

**A shared-state file on a branch the other tool never reads is a private note.**

If your work must live on a branch, the NOW.md update still goes to `main` on its own,
naming the branch and what is on it.

## 3. Never destroy — the collision rules

- **Never `git push --force`.** Ever, on any shared branch.
- **Never `git reset`/`git checkout --` a file you did not write this session.**
- **Same file, both changed → merge, do not overwrite.** When two versions conflict, the
  one with a *verification* attached wins; if neither has one, keep both and reconcile.
- **Never blind `git pull` on Oracle's `cto-aipa`** — it deploys by `scp` of named files
  plus `pm2 restart`, so its checkout is *meant* to lag `main`. Pulling is how a running
  process and its disk start disagreeing. (`VibeJobHunterAIPA_AIMCF` and `aideazz` are the
  opposite: they deploy by git and are held exactly at `origin/main`.)
- **One deployer at a time.** Before restarting a service, check its uptime. If it
  restarted in the last 10 minutes, someone is mid-deploy — wait.

## 4. Catch the other's fall — run this at session start

Every item below is a real failure that shipped. Two minutes, before any new work.

1. **Read this file, then `git log --oneline -15`.** Anything from the other agent you did
   not expect? Any work sitting on a branch?
2. **Did the last deploy actually take?** Process start time must be *newer* than the file
   it loads:
   `systemctl show vibejobhunter -p ActiveEnterTimestamp` vs `stat -c %y <file>`
3. **Did the last change produce OUTPUT, not just run?** This is the one that bites.
   A source logged "197 jobs" hourly for a full day and delivered zero. Grep the *result*
   line, never the *ran* line.
4. **Is any claim on the board stale?** Older than 2h with no commit → release it.
5. **Check the DELIBERATE list below before "fixing" anything that looks broken.**

## 5. How to pause — the handoff block

When you stop mid-task, replace the HANDOFF section with exactly these four lines. An
agent that pauses without one has lost the work, even if the code is committed.

- **DONE:** what is finished *and verified*, with the evidence
- **NEXT:** the single next action, concretely enough to start cold
- **VERIFIED BY:** the command or log line that proves the DONE claim
- **RISK:** what will break or mislead if the next agent assumes wrongly

## 6. 🚫 DELIBERATE — these look broken and are not. Do not "fix" them.

| Thing | Why it is like that |
|---|---|
| **Wellfound returns 0 / dormant** | Its private GraphQL API changed. Not scraped harder on purpose — re-guessing a private endpoint every release is a treadmill, not a source. |
| **YC Work at a Startup not scraped** | Its `/jobs` page *is* public and easy to parse. YC's ToS forbids automated extraction. robots.txt allowing ≠ ToS permission. |
| **agentic-engineering-jobs.com not wired** | Newest posting 33 days old, 91% past its own expiry. Rejected on measurement. |
| **Oracle `cto-aipa` behind `main`** | Deploys by named-file `scp`, not `git pull`. See rule 3. |
| **`test_provider_chain[claude]` fails** | Anthropic credits are at zero. The eval is *correctly* reporting it. |
| **AI-Jobs.net / BrightData LinkedIn dormant** | Measured lifetime yield ~0. Env flags exist to wake them. |

## 7. What belongs in this file

The queue and whose move it is · what is open or known-broken · what is stranded on a
branch · standing traps · what just landed, briefly.

**Not** here: architecture, post-mortems, anything already in `docs/`, the memory files or
the AI Ops Wiki. Link to those. **Keep it to one screen per part** — delete finished lines;
git log keeps the record.

# PART 2 — CURRENT STATE

## 🤝 HANDOFF

- **DONE:** HUD recommended AI reviews: **22 failed, certification
  withheld — publishing unaffected.** All 10 mandatory still passed.
  Complexity fail = AILA + atlas 0 LOC. Claims/rarity = 32 not-gradable
  snapshot. PII LLM = production CRM/WhatsApp trees, not the listing
  text. Do not chase.
- **NEXT:** Elena: paste cleared Describe if not already. Then **Make
  private to opportunity buyers**. Do not Go live. Do not re-run
  recommended checks. Wait for HUD proposal. Refuse exclusive.
- **VERIFIED BY:** Elena’s Quality checks paste 31 Aug: 22 failed /
  21 passed / 10 mandatory / 40 measured / 32 not gradable. HUD copy:
  “certification withheld — publishing unaffected.”
- **RISK:** Treating recommended fails as a publish block. Stripping
  `aipa@` / HubSpot from source to please pii-qc-llm would gut the
  product. Public Go live anchors under $89k. AfterQuery untouched.

## 💰 MONEY QUEUE

| # | Thing | State | Whose move |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **HUD Vendor — non-exclusive training licence** | **Ready.** 10/10 mandatory. 22 recommended failed (cert withheld, publish OK). **$74,851** | **Elena:** private to opportunity buyers. Do **not** chase recommended checks. Do not Go live. Refuse exclusive |
| 1b | **AfterQuery Atrium re-ask** | **Delivered** atrium@ + support@. founders@ bounced. Clicks on all three. No open event | **Elena: contact atrium@ / support@ today** |
| 2 | **Rwazi — AI Engineer, Marketing & GTM Systems** (contractor, 25–40h, US-overlap) | All answers + comp drafted. Now a HubSpot Hiring deal | **Elena: paste & submit** + record the Loom |
| 3 | **Plata — Automation Stream Lead** | Cover letter written | Elena: send |
| 4 | **Behram / AI Native Builder — LinkedIn comment** | Drafted, numbers verified | Elena: paste |
| 5 | **Work at a Startup profile** | Every field paste-ready | Elena: create the account — agent cannot (credential boundary) |

## 🌿 Stranded on the Cursor branch — do not lose, do not reset

`cursor/intelliops-bd-money-play-abc0`, last commit 25 Aug. Only there:
`scripts/hs-email-link-deal.cjs`, `hs-fix-send-buttons.cjs`, `hs-intelliops-story.cjs`,
`hs-note-intelliops-eval.cjs`, `intelliops-imap-pull.py`, `oracle-hs-note-intelliops.sh`.
⚠️ The branch is also **behind** `main` on many files — a naive merge would delete current
work. Port what you want by hand; never reset.

## 🔴 OPEN — do not assume these work

- **Anthropic credits at zero** since 17 Aug. The 5-provider chain absorbs it; nothing is
  down. Elena tops up, or leave it on OpenAI.
- **VJH outreach crash:** `[outreach] ERROR <company>: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'`
  — real, in the founder-email path, needs its own session.
- **~50 duplicate blog pages** need canonical consolidation. **Canonical only — never
  delete.** 21 pages carry the fabricated Redis stack; never canonicalise onto one.
- No Claude MCP in Cursor. Gmail MCP in Cursor needs auth. HubSpot from Cursor cloud
  agents routes through Oracle (no `api.hubapi.com` egress).

## ✅ JUST LANDED (29–30 Aug)

- **ai-native-builder.com wired into VJH** — densest source in the fleet, 72% gate pass
  vs ~21%. Memory: `project_ai_native_builder_source`.
- **Three pipeline bugs fixed** (`36e985c`) after that source ran a full day producing
  nothing: dedup ledger stamped before the cap (175 jobs burned per cycle), priority was a
  group not a ranking, and the judge believed Elena does not hand-code.
- **Board-quality guards:** `board_hygiene.py`, `scripts/qualify_job_board.py`, weekly
  Telegram watch (Tue 06:00 Panama).
- **Wiki incident published** `2026-08-30-marked-done-before-anyone-read-them`, `blog: yes`.
- **`/opspw` — ops dashboard lock resettable from Telegram** (`2faf9a7`). The `/ops/`
  password was lost; a bcrypt hash cannot be recovered, only replaced. Helper
  `scripts/oracle-resilience/set-opspw-stdin.sh` → Oracle `/home/ubuntu/`, mode 700.
  Backs up, writes bcrypt, verifies the LIVE endpoint two ways (new password 200 **and**
  anonymous still 401), auto-rolls-back on either failure. Done in prod: 44→67 bytes,
  hash now `$2y$`, rollback did not fire. **Username is hardcoded** — it cannot mint
  accounts. Whoever holds the Telegram account can reset that lock; that is the accepted
  trade for phone-only access, not an oversight.

## ⚠️ Standing traps

- **Never `git add -A`** in cto-aipa. Named files only.
- **Claude Code `Auto` mode blocks all credential-store work** — reading `.htpasswd`,
  grepping `auth_basic`, and *editing your own permission list*. That last refusal is
  deliberate: an agent cannot self-approve escalation. Do not try to slip it past by
  renaming files or burying the logic in a compiled bundle. Ask Elena to switch the mode
  selector (bottom-left) from `Auto` to `Manual` — every blocked command then succeeds on
  the first try. Not `Bypass permissions`; that disarms everything session-wide.
- Oracle runs VJH under `venv/bin/python` — bare `python3` dies on `pydantic_settings`.
- Do **not** `source .env` — `FROM_EMAIL` has spaces and angle brackets; syntax error.
  Read keys with `grep`/`cut`.
- After any deploy: restart, prove it from `journalctl`, **and check the OUTCOME.**
- **hud.io ≠ hud.ai ≠ DataVendor API.** Cursor `Hud: Sign In` is a plugin.
  The licence buyer is DataVendor (`datavendor.ai`). Their estimator:
  **public = $0**. REST/MCP is evals, not the quote. Do not add
  `openclaw-vibejob-shortlist` (MIT), `ascent-saas-builder` (Lovable),
  or `atlas-shifted` (still public) to the Ready 8-pack. Packet:
  `docs/selling/HUD_VENDOR_LICENSE.md` on `cursor/hud-vendor-license-1c49`.
- **No fourth Lazarus.** Codebase buyers that quote: Lazarus, Atrium
  (AfterQuery), HUD. Lazarus: solo / no team+P&L. Atrium **25 Aug**:
  round closed (volume), not quality; they do not keep the trees. HUD
  saw them already private tonight. Flip ≠ never-public. Hashseatic is
  not a quote. Next dollars: HUD number, AfterQuery click follow-up, jobs.

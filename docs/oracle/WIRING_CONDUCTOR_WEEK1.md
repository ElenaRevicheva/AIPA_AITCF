# Week 1 — Wiring Audit & Build Log

**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Author:** CTO AIPA (Claude Code) + Elena Revicheva
**Status:** In Progress
**Purpose:** Wire the AIdeazz 10-agent ecosystem into a single outcome-tracking system

---

## Context

CMO AIPA strategic audit revealed: all 10 agents produce activity, none track outcomes. Content gets likes, not clients. Applications may not be delivered. The only revenue source (EspaLuz) can't distinguish free from paid users. This build wires it up.

---

## Pre-Build Audits (Completed 2026-04-02)

### Audit 1: VibeJobHunter Eval Framework — Layer 4 (LLM-as-Judge)

**Status: ✅ CONFIRMED DONE**

| Layer | File | Tests | Runtime | Cost |
|-------|------|-------|---------|------|
| 1 — Keyword scoring | `evals/test_keyword_scoring.py` | ~50 | <5s | $0 |
| 2 — Bias compensation | `evals/test_bias_compensation.py` | ~67 | <5s | $0 |
| 3 — Full pipeline (golden set) | `evals/test_full_pipeline.py` | ~22 | 2–10s | $0 |
| 4 — LLM-as-judge | `evals/test_llm_judge.py` | 14 | 15–45s | ~$0.03–0.08 |
| **TOTAL** | | **131** | | |

Layer 4 details:
- Real Claude API calls (Haiku model) — not stubs
- 12 curated judge cases with expected verdicts (APPLY/OUTREACH/REVIEW/DISCARD)
- 22-job golden set integration test
- 75% agreement threshold enforced (hard assertion)
- Elena's honest profile embedded: gaps (RAG, LangGraph, AWS), strengths (multi-agent, voice, routing)
- Graceful skip if API key missing (doesn't break CI)

**Interview answer unlocked:** "I built a 4-layer eval harness — 131 tests, $0.08/run. Layer 4 uses Claude as an independent judge to validate my deterministic scoring engine against 22 golden-set jobs. Agreement threshold is 75% — deliberately below 100% because edge cases have legitimate ambiguity."

---

### Audit 2: VibeJobHunter Application Delivery

**Status: ❌ CRITICAL — Applications are NOT verified as delivered**

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| `ATS_DRY_RUN=true` by default | All form submissions are simulated. Never clicks submit. |
| 253 "application artifacts" | Local text files: cover letter + resume. Not sent to employers. |
| Success detection | Page text matching ("thank you"), not HTTP status codes |
| Confirmation IDs | Auto-generated timestamps (`GH_20260402_1912`), not from employers |
| Email stats | `total_sent: 0`, empty `sent_emails` array — zero outreach actually sent |
| Database gap | No field for employer-issued confirmation ID or delivery status |
| Outreach emails | Block list includes `careers@`, `jobs@`, `hr@`, `recruiting@` — the exact addresses applications go to |

**Verdict:** Elena has been relying on a system that generates materials locally but has no verified delivery to any employer. The 253 artifacts and 148 outreach messages are local files.

**Action required:** This is a VibeJobHunter repo fix, not a CTO AIPA build. Documented here for tracking. Fix requires:
1. Set `ATS_DRY_RUN=false` when ready for live submission
2. Log HTTP response codes from actual ATS form submissions
3. Capture employer-issued confirmation IDs (not auto-generated)
4. Add delivery verification fields to database
5. Re-evaluate blocked email patterns (blocking the exact addresses needed)

---

### Audit 3: EspaLuz Payment System

**Status: ❌ BROKEN — Cannot reliably distinguish free from paid users**

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| PayPal webhook signature verification | **Disabled** — any request can trigger subscription updates |
| Trial-to-paid detection | Fails — users who subscribe via PayPal not auto-linked |
| Dual storage | PostgreSQL + JSON with no sync = data inconsistency |
| Subscription cancellation | No sync — access not revoked when PayPal cancels |
| Gumroad | Account suspended, feature disabled |
| Subscriber data | WhatsApp: 3 entries in JSON. Telegram: entries from January 2026. |
| PayPal plan IDs | WhatsApp: `P-38A73508FY163121MNCJXTYY`, Telegram: `P-6GR95409C95293139NFSBJJY` |

**Key files:**
- `EspaLuzWhatsApp/paypal_webhook.py` — signature verification skipped (line 43)
- `EspaLuzWhatsApp/user_trial_system.py` — core trial management
- `EspaLuzWhatsApp/whatsapp_email_linking.py` — email/subscription linking
- `EspaLuzFamilybot/espaluz_paypal_system.py` — 1800+ lines, core PayPal integration

**Action required:** Fix in EspaLuz repos. PayPal webhook → Oracle `espaluz_funnel` table is part of this week's CTO AIPA build.

---

## Week 1 Build: CTO AIPA Wiring Layer

### What we're building

CTO AIPA becomes the temporary conductor of all 10 agents by adding:

1. **`agent_outcomes` table** — every agent writes what it did + whether it worked
2. **`business_leads` table** — track engagement signals from LinkedIn/social
3. **`espaluz_funnel` table** — track every user from trial → paid → churned
4. **CRUD functions** for all three tables
5. **Unified daily briefing** extending existing `/daily` command

### Architecture decision

**CTO AIPA = conductor now. AILA = real product later.**

Rationale: CTO AIPA already has voice-first intent detection, 7-day persistent memory, 80+ commands, Oracle DB access, Telegram delivery, and 8 AM cron briefing. Adding 3 tables + outcome tracking is ~1,000 lines. Building AILA from scratch (Hive/Python, pgvector entity store, Judge-gated delivery) is a 3-6 month product build. AILA inherits the outcome data when it ships — the `agent_outcomes` table is the same regardless of which bot reads it.

Documented in: `docs/aila/AILA_INHERITANCE_ANALYSIS.md`

---

### New Oracle Tables

#### `agent_outcomes`

```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_outcomes (
  id RAW(16) DEFAULT SYS_GUID() PRIMARY KEY,
  agent_name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
  action_type VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
  action_detail CLOB,
  outcome_status VARCHAR2(50) DEFAULT 'pending_verification',
  outcome_detail CLOB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  verified_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

`outcome_status` values: `pending_verification`, `verified_delivered`, `verified_failed`, `no_outcome`, `outcome_positive`, `outcome_negative`

#### `business_leads`

```sql
CREATE TABLE business_leads (
  id RAW(16) DEFAULT SYS_GUID() PRIMARY KEY,
  source VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR2(500),
  context CLOB,
  signal_strength VARCHAR2(20) DEFAULT 'low',
  status VARCHAR2(50) DEFAULT 'new',
  next_action VARCHAR2(1000),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

`signal_strength`: `high` (commented/DM'd), `medium` (liked + visited), `low` (liked only)
`status`: `new`, `contacted`, `in_conversation`, `converted`, `lost`

#### `espaluz_funnel`

```sql
CREATE TABLE espaluz_funnel (
  id RAW(16) DEFAULT SYS_GUID() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
  channel VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
  trial_start TIMESTAMP,
  trial_end TIMESTAMP,
  messages_sent NUMBER DEFAULT 0,
  last_active TIMESTAMP,
  converted NUMBER(1) DEFAULT 0,
  payment_status VARCHAR2(50) DEFAULT 'trial',
  paypal_subscription_id VARCHAR2(100),
  retention_message_sent NUMBER(1) DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

`payment_status`: `trial`, `active`, `cancelled`, `churned`, `expired`

## Updates Since Week 1 (April 2026)

| Item | Status (Apr 18) | Detail |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| **VJH eval framework** | ✅ Complete (Mar 30) | 131 tests, 4 layers (keyword, bias, golden-set, LLM-as-judge). All green. Verified from actual code in `evals/`. |
| **VJH founder outreach email** | ✅ Fixed (Apr 10) | `FROM_EMAIL` corrected to `aipa@aideazz.xyz`, `_send_email_message` TypeError fixed, `_extract_email` no longer returns `careers@` addresses. Claude retry resilience added. |
| **VJH hard gate recalibration** | ✅ Done (Apr 10) | Senior/Staff/Principal excluded, IT outsourcers penalized, career gate pass rate tightened to ~20.7%. |
| **VJH ATS_DRY_RUN** | ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION | Was `true` on Apr 2. Needs server-side check: `grep ATS_DRY_RUN /home/ubuntu/VibeJobHunterAIPA_AIMCF/.env` |
| **EspaLuz PayPal webhook** | ❌ Still broken | Signature verification still disabled. Free/paid user detection unreliable. |
| **`agent_outcomes` table** | ✅ Deployed | Table exists in Oracle, `saveAgentOutcome` used by lead triage (`triage_cycle`). |
| **`business_leads` table** | ✅ Deployed | Table exists, receives inquiry form submissions via `/marketing/inquiry-proxy`. |
| **`espaluz_funnel` table** | ✅ Deployed | Table created. EspaLuz repos not yet wiring writes to it. |
| **Unified briefing** | ⏳ Partial | `/daily` exists but doesn't pull from all 3 tables yet. |
| **GEO+SEO Marketing Engine** | ✅ Complete (Apr 17-18) | Phases 1-5 shipped: JSON-LD, sitemap (11 URLs), daily blog publishing, UTM attribution, outreach, lead triage. Phase 1f: www→apex 301, hreflang, 404 noindex. |
| **Oracle wallet** | ✅ Fixed (Apr 14) | Fresh wallet, correct WALLET_LOCATION, WALLET_PASSWORD in .env. |

| **EspaLuz Telegram — 2-layer RAG memory** | ✅ **Done (Apr 25, 2026)** | LangChain retrieval wired (`chat_history.messages[-5:]`) + pgvector semantic RAG (`espaluz_rag.py`, `espaluz_embeddings` table, OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`, cosine sim > 0.75, top_k=3). Both layers injected into Claude system prompt via `format_mcp_request()`. Save wired after every turn. Confirmed in prod logs: "✅ RAG embeddings saved for session 8c6fd9e0..." |
| **EspaLuz WhatsApp — 2-layer RAG memory** | ✅ **Done (Apr 25, 2026)** | Same `espaluz_rag.py` deployed to WhatsApp repo. Retrieval appended to `personalized_db_context` (existing personalization layer preserved). Two save blocks wired: voice/Spanish path (`spanish_input`) + text path (`message_text`). Session namespace: `whatsapp_*`. Confirmed in prod logs: "📚 LangChain: 5 recent turns retrieved" + "✅ RAG embeddings saved for session 51e064f5..." Pre-existing bug noted: `Enhancement error: slice(None, 5, None)` — non-critical. |
| **VJH LangGraph pipeline** | ✅ **Done (Apr 26, 2026)** | Replaces raw for-loop in `orchestrator.run_autonomous_cycle()`. 7-node StateGraph: gate → score → route → submit/outreach/discard → notify. SQLite checkpointer (`autonomous_data/vjh_checkpoint.db`). `thread_id=vjh_{job_id}` — skips already-processed jobs (fixes Deel ×7 deduplication). `interrupt_before=["submit_node"]` — score 60–69 pauses, sends Telegram ask, resumes on `/approve_vjh_{id}`. submit_node captures real HTTP status + confirmation_id (no more silent failures). Outreach node respects daily cap (2/day). Fallback to legacy pipeline on LangGraph error. **Confirmed live on Oracle**: first cycle processed 8 jobs, all discarded correctly, zero errors. `langgraph>=0.2.0` installed in VJH venv. |
| **VJH ATS_DRY_RUN verified** | ✅ **Verified (Apr 26, 2026)** | `ATS_DRY_RUN=false` confirmed on Oracle — flag was already off. Real problem was Resend rate limiting (3/hour cap) and deduplication failures (Deel ×7, Vanta ×4). LangGraph pipeline now addresses both. |
| **Resume updated on Oracle** | ✅ **Done (Apr 26, 2026)** | `autonomous_data/resumes/elena_resume.pdf` replaced. Claude Code + Cursor now explicit in summary + dedicated CORE SKILLS section. pgvector/RAG added. Railway removed. Target roles expanded (AI Systems Operator, Automation Lead, Integration Specialist, Solutions Architect, AI Program Manager). generator at `aideazz/scripts/generate_resume.py`. |

**Version:** 1.4 — Updated 2026-05-15 (Multi-agent HubSpot hub + BrightData enrichment + blog pipeline fixes)

## Session: May 14–15, 2026

### What was wired

#### HubSpot CRM Hub — `/api/crm-event`

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **`/api/crm-event`** | Unified hub endpoint in CTO AIPA. All agents POST here. Validates, deduplicates vs Oracle `outreach_targets`, writes to HubSpot, logs to `crm_event_log`. Live at `https://webhook.aideazz.xyz/cto/api/crm-event`. Auth: `Bearer OUTREACH_SECRET`. |
| **`/api/crm-pipeline/setup`** | Returns free-tier HubSpot strategy: `[HIRING] {jobTitle} @ {company}` naming in Sales Pipeline. Stage map: applied→Appointment Scheduled, recruiter_responded→Qualified to Buy, interview_scheduled→Presentation Scheduled, offer_received→Decision Maker Bought-In, accepted→Closed Won, declined→Closed Lost. |
| **`/api/crm-pipeline/ids`** | Reads existing pipeline IDs directly from HubSpot API. |
| **`src/hubspot-client.ts` additions** | `HS_HIRING_PIPELINE_ID`, `HS_HIRING_STAGE_IDS`, `HiringStage` type, `createHiringPipeline()` (documents free-tier 1-pipeline limitation), `pushHiringDealToHubSpot(input: HiringDealInput)` — full Contact+Company+Deal pipeline for job applications. |

#### VJH → HubSpot (Step 3)

`src/langgraph_pipeline/crm_hub.py` (NEW file in VibeJobHunterAIPA_AIMCF). After each job application in `nodes.py`, posts to `/api/crm-event` with `pipeline=hiring`. Env vars added to VJH: `OUTREACH_SECRET`, `CTO_AIPA_WEBHOOK_URL=https://webhook.aideazz.xyz/cto`.

#### Algom Alpha → HubSpot (Step 2)

`pushProspectToCRM()` added to `dragontrade-agent/stream-listener.js`. Fires on high-intent keyword matches from filtered stream: `need_cto`, `ai_engineer_hiring`, `crm_pain`, `ai_founder`, `fractional_cto`. Routes to Client Pipeline in HubSpot. Env vars added: `OUTREACH_SECRET`, `CTO_AIPA_WEBHOOK_URL`.

#### BrightData Web Unlocker (Step 4 equivalent)

`src/brightdata-enrich.ts` (NEW file in AIPA_AITCF). Functions: `bdFetch()`, `extractFromPageText()`, `batchEnrichLeads()`, `isBrightDataConfigured()`. Scrapes company websites for founder names, tech stack, team size, funding signals. Zone: `web_unlocker1`, $1.50/CPM, 30-day trial active. Integrated into `fresh-leads-ingest.ts` — runs after dedup, before Claude pain classification. Max 10 enrichments/run, 1 req/sec throttle. Env added to Oracle `.env`: `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN=77c17e6d-bb2d-42da-84d5-f300420a1721`, `BRIGHTDATA_ZONE=web_unlocker1`.

#### Blog/Content Pipeline Fixes

| Fix | Detail |
|-----|--------|
| Hashnode fully removed | Dev.to-only for cross-posting. All Hashnode GraphQL calls removed. |
| 20-topic rotation | Was 10 — prevents slug collision and topic recycling. |
| `slugAlreadyPublished()` | Dedup check added in `src/hashnode-daily.ts`. |
| FAQ blocks mandatory | Every article requires `## Frequently Asked Questions` with 3–5 Q&A pairs (GEO optimization). |
| FAQPage JSON-LD | Injected in `BlogPost.tsx` from article markdown. |
| `/blog/posts` endpoint | Oracle endpoint for portfolio blog index sync — reads `data/blog-posts-cache.json` first, Oracle `content_log` additive. |

#### Status after this session

Steps 1–5 of Phase 5.6 multi-agent HubSpot plan: ✅ DONE. Step 6 (CMO LinkedIn / Make.com) = ⏳ pending.


---

## 🆕 May 20 2026 status update

### ✅ Closed this session

- **HubSpot dashboard Step 1 — source prefix system.** All 5 active HubSpot writers (crm_hub.py, serpapi_jobs_ingest.py, serpapi-prospects.ts, fresh-leads-ingest.ts + lead-triage.ts, algom-poll.js + stream-listener.js) now stamp `sourcePrefix` into dealname. Helper functions in `hubspot-client.ts` wrap as `[STREAM-AGENT] {baseName}`. Smoke-tested end-to-end. See `docs/HUBSPOT_NAMING.md` for prefix table.
- **Sprinter voice → morning briefing.** Telegram voice handler now persists every voice note to Oracle `knowledge_base` as `voice_note` category. `/sprint-knowledge` endpoint fetches them alongside diary + tasks so Lambda briefing includes voice context.

### 🟡 New pending items

- **Step 2 — bulk-rename existing ~175 HubSpot deals** with the right prefix (script reads each deal's source/description field, prepends correct tag).
- **Step 3 — HubSpot UI stage rename** (Elena's hands; both available HubSpot tokens lack `crm.pipelines.write` scope). Proposed labels (under review): 📥 Just arrived / 🔥 Reach out TODAY / ⚡ Reach out this week / ✉️ Sent — waiting / 💬 They replied — YOUR TURN / ✅ Won / ❌ No fit.
- **xAI key wiring.** `XAI_API_KEY` added to cto-aipa + dragontrade env on May 20 2026, not yet wired. Three concrete next options: Algom backup listener / Grok in model routing / xAI team X API.

### Still red (carry forward)

- `fresh-leads-ingest.ts` PATH B still ungated (no JobGate-equivalent filter — TS port pending).
- Resend 422 emails: `Founder @ DiaMonTech AG@DiaMonTech AG` — company name pasted as email address (bug in outreach draft path, not yet investigated).
- Hashnode dead-code cleanup: `hashnode-daily.ts` only publishes to Dev.to now; file name + ~500 lines of dead Hashnode types are stale.
- CMO LinkedIn engagement → HubSpot: Make.com posts work, but reply/comment events never flow back to HubSpot.
- EspaLuz PayPal subscriber + WhatsApp chat events → HubSpot: not wired.


---

## NEW May 22 2026 status update

### Closed this session

- **Blog SEO discoverability (the per-article SSR problem).** Per-article static HTML generation deployed via cto-aipa 8984a02 + aideazz e4fe4ee. 14 articles backfilled. All /blog/SLUG URLs now serve article-specific HTML with proper meta tags + JSON-LD + article body. Google can finally rank each article individually. Verified live with curl.
- **hashnode-daily.ts tech debt.** Renamed to daily-blog-publisher.ts with git history preserved. Import in cto-aipa.ts updated. Build clean.

### Still red (carry forward)

- response_detector.py Zoho IMAP poll: still dormant. When recruiters reply to VJH-LEAD manual applies, HubSpot doesn't auto-move to They replied. THE single highest-leverage gap remaining.
- CMO LinkedIn engagement return webhook (Make.com to /api/crm-event): not wired
- EspaLuz PayPal subscriber events to HubSpot: not wired
- Resend 422 emails ("Founder @ DiaMonTech AG@DiaMonTech AG" pattern): not investigated
- 6 dead HASHNODE_* env vars in cto-aipa .env: leave for future cleanup (only HASHNODE_DAILY_* are still read; rest are harmless)


---

## NEW May 24 2026 (evening) status update

### Closed this session (deployed + verified live)

- **AEO / FAQPage JSON-LD schema.** Every article on aideazz.xyz now emits FAQPage structured data extracted from the markdown FAQ section. Google AI Overview / Perplexity / Bing Chat can now cite your Q&A pairs as authoritative answers. Commit c053548. AEO score moved from 4/10 to 9/10.
- **Groq log noise (413 + 429).** Pre-check at 24K chars skips Groq for oversized PR diffs. 60s cooldown after 429. Net: log noise dropped ~95%. Commits 7d5c01f + 44c26bc.
- **Claude Code Remote Control activation.** Works end-to-end. Desktop launcher script + ritual documented in ORACLE_ALL_PRODUCTS_RESILIENCE.md. Elena can now drive Claude Code from her phone during karate / errands while laptop processes.

### Still red (carry forward — unchanged from May 22)

- response_detector.py Zoho IMAP poll: still dormant. **THE single highest-leverage gap remaining for VJH manual-apply tracking.**
- CMO LinkedIn engagement return webhook (Make.com to /api/crm-event): not wired
- EspaLuz PayPal subscriber events to HubSpot: not wired
- EspaLuz WhatsApp/Telegram chat user events to HubSpot: not wired
- Resend 422 emails ("Founder @ DiaMonTech AG@DiaMonTech AG" malformed-recipient pattern): not investigated
- 6 dead HASHNODE_* env vars in cto-aipa .env: leave for future cleanup (harmless, only HASHNODE_DAILY_* still read)


## NEW May 24-25 2026 status update (closed-loop + dashboard hygiene)

This session closed every remaining "noise" gap in the daily operator surface
(Telegram + HubSpot + Trello) and shipped the inbox-to-CRM loop. Net effect:
the daily morning briefing now shows ONLY real issues. Zero hallucinated focus
suggestions, zero stale-repo spam, zero triage-already-pushed re-surfacing,
zero Resend 422 noise.

### Closed this session (deployed + verified live)

- **response_detector → HubSpot loop closed (commit a65216c).** Detector now
  POSTs every classified recruiter response to `/api/crm-event` with
  `pipeline=hiring`, `stage=recruiter_responded`, `sourcePrefix=HIRING-VJH-LEAD`.
  Sender blocklist filters platform-noise domains (torre.ai, substack, outlier,
  zohocalendar, mindrift, hireflix, onhires, noreply). 16 missed recruiter
  responses backfilled — including Maddy Sky interview from May 16 that had
  been buried in noise for over a week.
- **HubSpot → Trello bridge (commit b2b795b).** Urgent deals (`qualifiedtobuy`
  + `contractsent` stages) fire a one-way push to the current-month
  "Kira {Mes} 2026" board, "Just for Today" column. Idempotent via
  `[hs:dealId]` tag. Auto-detects Panama-time month. 67 cards backfilled to
  "Kira Mayo 2026" on first run.
- **Triage dedup (commits 84f9e15 + 3d4139c).** `lead_triage` rows marked
  `pushed_to_hubspot` after successful HubSpot push. `getTriagedLeads` filters
  status NOT IN ('pushed_to_hubspot', 'archived', 'dismissed') — daily brief
  no longer re-surfaces leads already in your CRM. HubSpot becomes the source
  of truth for "what to act on"; brief shows only fresh signal.
- **Proactive stale-repo alert dedup (commit 5e93cab).** Threshold raised
  5d → 14d. Per-repo `lastStaleRepoAlertAt` Map with 24h cooldown. Before: 6
  alerts/day for the same EspaLuzWhatsApp. After: at most 1 alert/day, and
  only when genuinely stale (2+ weeks).
- **Outreach 422 noise eliminated (commit 7796438 + DB backfill).**
  `isBogusOutreachEmail()` helper filters bogus patterns ("Founder @ X",
  whitespace, missing TLD, leading/trailing dot, RFC-fail) before send.
  Backfilled 68 existing `outreach_targets` rows → `status='invalid_email'`.
  Final distribution: `invalid_email=109, emailed=41`. Phase 4 daily summary
  no longer contains Resend 422 spam.
- **Morning briefing deterministic real-issues (commit 7c7d910).** The
  "💡 Today" line was a Groq hallucination from a content-less prompt — same
  EspaLuz focus suggestion every day. Replaced with deterministic, signal-
  driven "🚨 Today's real issues" section. Renders only when CMO is offline
  OR an AIDEAZZ repo has been silent >14 days. On clean days the section is
  omitted entirely (no "✅ all clear" filler). Reuses module-scope
  `STALE_REPO_THRESHOLD_DAYS=14` — single source of truth with the
  proactive-alert dedup logic.

### Still red (carry forward)

- CMO LinkedIn engagement return webhook (Make.com → `/api/crm-event`): not wired
- EspaLuz PayPal subscriber events → HubSpot: not wired
- EspaLuz WhatsApp/Telegram chat user events → HubSpot: not wired
- 6 dead HASHNODE_* env vars in cto-aipa .env: leave for future cleanup
  (harmless, only HASHNODE_DAILY_* still read)

### Pattern that emerged this session

> "Detection without action is theater." Every closure this session followed
> the same shape: a signal was being computed but discarded (recruiter
> responses detected but not pushed; bogus emails attempted instead of
> filtered; LLM suggestions confabulated instead of grounded). The fix was
> always wiring the signal to a deterministic action — never adding more
> intelligence, always closing a loop.

## 🔧 CTO AIPA - Deep Dive (My Most Complex Project)

**What it is:** A Telegram bot that acts as an AI technical co-founder.

**Architecture:**
```
Telegram Bot (Grammy.js)
    ↓
40 Command Handlers
    ↓
AI Layer (Claude Opus 4 / Groq Llama 3.3)
    ↓
Oracle Autonomous Database (8 tables)
    ↓
GitHub API (Octokit)
```

**Key Features I Built:**
- **Safe code generation:** AI generates code → human reviews → `/approve` creates PR
- **Strategic intelligence:** `/strategy` analyzes ecosystem, `/priorities` suggests daily focus
- **Learning system:** Bot learns from `/feedback` and improves over time
- **Cursor Agent simulator:** `/cursor` gives step-by-step instructions for local Cursor IDE
- **Production monitoring:** `/health` checks API status, `/logs` analyzes error logs
- **Context-aware reviews:** Fetches package.json, past decisions before reviewing code

**Database Schema (Oracle):**
- `memory` - conversation context
- `tech_debt` - tracked issues
- `arch_decisions` - architectural decision records
- `lessons` - learned patterns from feedback
- `pending_code` - approval workflow queue

**Lines of Code:** ~8,000 (TypeScript)

**Deployment:** Oracle Cloud VM, PM2, auto-restart on failure

## 🌟 Why Me?

**What I bring:**

1. **I ship fast.** 6 deployed products in 10 months, solo. I use AI tools effectively to move at startup speed.

2. **I understand the full stack.** From LLM prompts to database schemas to deployment. I've touched every layer.

3. **I have executive experience.** 7 years managing teams means I understand business context, not just code.

4. **I'm hungry.** I relocated to Panama, rebuilt from zero, and I'm looking for the right team to grow with.

**What I'm still learning:**

- Deeper ML/model training (currently focused on API-level LLM work)
- Large-scale production systems (my current scale is small)
- Team collaboration on codebases (mostly solo work so far)
